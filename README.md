Simulation and analysis code for the manuscript on flexibility in two-cell information

* Code/ -- All simulation code in python and SLURM scripts to execute simulations
* Data/Collected -- All collected summary statistics of the simulation data, used to generate the figures in the manuscript.
* Data/Raw -- The setup files to generate the simulation results. Storage of the raw simulation results would consume too much storage.
* Plot/ -- All scripts used to make the figures for the manuscript. Uses the data in Data/Collected.
* Figures/ -- The output of the Plot/ scripts. The figures used for the manuscript
* Mathematica/ -- The analytic calculation for the Gaussian results
